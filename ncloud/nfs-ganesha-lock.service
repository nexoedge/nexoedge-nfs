# This file is part of nfs-ganesha.
#
# rpc.statd is started by the nfs-lock.service, but that also loads the 'lockd'
# kernel module in 'ExecStartPre'. The 'lockd' kernel module will register
# itself as 'nlockmgr' which conflicts with the nfs-ganesha locking
# implementation.
#
# This unit includes all the nfs-lock.service settings and details, but
# overrides the 'ExecStartPre' and 'ExecStartPost' options.
#
# When this unit is started, the original nfs-lock.service is stopped (due to
# the 'Conflicts' directive). With stopping the nfs-lock.service, 'lockd' gets
# instructed to unregister 'nlockmgr' from the portmapper.
#
# The nfs-ganesha.service depends on this unit.
