# This file is part of nfs-ganesha.
#
# There can only be one NFS-server active on a system. When NFS-Ganesha is
# started, the kernel NFS-server should have been stopped. This is achieved by
# the 'Conflicts' directive in this unit.
#
# The Network Locking Manager (rpc.statd) is provided by the nfs-utils package.
# NFS-Ganesha comes with its own nfs-ganesha-lock.service to resolve potential
# conflicts in starting multiple rpc.statd processes. See the comments in the
# nfs-ganesha-lock.service for more details.
